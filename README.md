# IMPORTANT NOTES TO GET THIS WORKING

## If not using Void Linux:

Modify the two `X11` library lines in `config.mk` and uncomment the default values


## Additional dependencies

* **compton** or **xcompmgr** for alpha 
* You might need **st-terminfo** if st inputs seem broken (in void linux anyway)

composition manager needs to be running for alpha to work
